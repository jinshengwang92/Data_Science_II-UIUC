# INFO 490: Advanced Data Science offered @ UIUC Spring 2017
***Professor:*** Dr. Robert J. Brunner


This class is an asynchronous, online course. This course will introduce
and explore advanced data science concepts through practical
demonstration of algorithms and technologies on cloud computing systems.

We learn about the basic tasks in machine learning, including
the importance of data preparation. Next, linear regression is
introduced along with concepts like regularization and an extension to
logistic regression. Supervised learning is introduced with examples for
both classification and regression presented including naive Bayes,
k-nn, SVM, decision trees, and ensemble techniques. Unsupervised
techniques are presented with applications in both clustering and
dimensional reduction. Specific application areas are explored for
these machine learning techniques, including text analysis, network
analysis, and social media analysis. The last part of the course focuses
on cloud computing technologies, including Hadoop, MapReduce, NoSQL data
stores, Spark, and streaming data analysis. The course concludes with a
brief introduction of deep learning.
