This includes learning how to use scikit learn to perform different types of machine learning as well as the scikit learn (`sklearn`) and `statsmodel` libraries to perform regression. We also will explore the important, and often overlooked task, of data pre-processing. This includes handling missing or invalid data, computation of dates, and understanding the data provenance.\n",
