       "This week we introduce Hadoop, perhaps the dominant method of big data processing in use today. Originally, Hadoop was develop to enable MapReduce tasks to be quickly executed. While this paradigm is still in place, new paradigms, such as Spark, are also now available, which means Hadoop will continue to exist as an important part of the Big Data landscape for much longer. This week, you will learn about Hadoop, and specifically the Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS), the MapReduce programming paradigm, and the Pig platform, which simplifies the task of writing MapReduce tasks.\n",
