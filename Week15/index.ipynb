       "This week we introduce deep learning. Deep learning has become an incredibly popular form of machine learning that generally leveraged some type of neural network to learn from data in order to make predictions. While neural networks have been around for some time, deep learning is fairly new, and has found applications in many areas, especially image processing and natural language processing. In the one lesson for this week, we will introduce neural networks and deep learning, as well as provide additional resources for future study.\n",
