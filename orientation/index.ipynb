If you wish to work off campus, you must first [VPN](https://techservices.illinois.edu/services/virtual-private-networking-vpn) into campus. To learn how to connect to this server, and how to work with the course material, you should logon to the course [JupyterHub server][cs], and locate, run, and explore the [Introduction to IPython](../notebooks/intro2ipy.ipynb) notebook to become familiar with using notebooks on the course JupyterHub server. \n",

Note that we include read only copies of the data and course material and writeable versions so you can experiment and learn.\n",

       "- Log in frequently to manage your messages on a near-daily basis. If you let them pile up for 3 to 4 days, you might be overwhelmed. You should start working on new weekly content right away, on Monday of each week.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Stay on top of the course work. Falling behind will make it harder to catch up, and even harder to understand new concepts that build on previous lessons.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Consider using a source code repository to archive all of your work so that you have an automatic backup copy of all your assignments. This will also be useful in the unlikely event that our server goes down and we are unable to access course submissions. In this situation, you are still required to keep current on all your tasks and must be prepared to submit completed materials as soon as submission capability is restored.\n",
       "\n",
       "- When possible, provide tips and suggestions to your peers in this class. As a learning community, we can help each other learn and grow. One way of doing this is by helping to address the questions that your peers pose. By engaging with each other, we'll all learn better.\n",
